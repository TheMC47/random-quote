# Archived: This repository was created as an exercise during the awesome [Practical Course â€“ Contributing to an Open-Source Project](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/osp/WS20/). It should include some "FOSS Best practices": a good README, issue templates, code of conduct, etc. The program is just a toy program.

# Installation
## Installing from source
Currently, this is the only way to install `random-quote`. 
#### Prerequisites
You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). 
### Instuctions
Once you have the required prerequisites, you can execute the following commands to do the install:
```bash
